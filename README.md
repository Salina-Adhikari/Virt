Signup Automation - QA Intern Task (Vrit Technologies)

Candidate:Salina Adhikari

Overview
This project automates the signup process for https://authorized-partner.netlify.app/login using Python & Selenium.  
I was able to complete Account Setup, Agency Details, Professional Experience, and OTP Verification..  
Due to a time crunch, the final Verification & Preferences page is not fully automated.  
I have demonstrated my ability to automate most of the flow with OTP verification included.

- OS: Windows 10  
- Python: 3.10  
- Browser: Chrome (latest)  
- ChromeDriver handled by `webdriver-manager`
